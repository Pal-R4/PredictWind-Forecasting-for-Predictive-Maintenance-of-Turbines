# PredictWind:Forecasting-Wind-Turbine-Failures-for-Cost-Effective-Maintenance
With a growing focus on reducing the environmental impact of energy production, renewable energy sources are becoming more integral to the global energy mix. Wind energy, in particular, has become one of the most advanced renewable technologies worldwide. This project harnesses machine learning to predict failures in wind turbines, enabling more efficient maintenance and lowering operational costs.

Project Objective
ReneWind is dedicated to enhancing the machinery and processes involved in wind energy generation. By predicting potential component failures before they happen, we can schedule proactive maintenance, minimizing costly breakdowns. This project involves building and fine-tuning classification models to identify failures based on historical sensor data.

1 in the target variable signifies a failure
0 indicates no failure
Interpreting Model Predictions
True Positives (TP): Correctly predicted failures.
False Negatives (FN): Actual failures that the model failed to detect.
False Positives (FP): Instances where the model predicted a failure, but no failure occurred.
Calculating Maintenance Costs
To evaluate the model, we calculate a maintenance cost based on predictions. The cost is computed as:

Maintenance Cost
=
(
TP
×
Repair Cost
)
+
(
FN
×
Replacement Cost
)
+
(
FP
×
Inspection Cost
)
Maintenance Cost=(TP×Repair Cost)+(FN×Replacement Cost)+(FP×Inspection Cost)
Where:

Replacement Cost = $40,000
Repair Cost = $15,000
Inspection Cost = $5,000
Our aim is to minimize the maintenance cost ratio, calculated as:

Maintenance Cost Ratio
=
Minimum Possible Maintenance Cost
Model Maintenance Cost
Maintenance Cost Ratio= 
Model Maintenance Cost
Minimum Possible Maintenance Cost
​
This ratio ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating that the model’s cost equals the minimum possible maintenance cost.

**Data Overview**
The provided data is a transformed version of sensor data gathered from wind turbines. 
It consists of:

Train.csv: Used for training and tuning the models, containing 40 predictor variables and 1 target variable.\
Test.csv: Used exclusively for evaluating the performance of the final selected model.
Our pipeline performance (Minimum_vs_Model_cost ≈ 0.799) shows that the model accurately replicates the desired results after preprocessing.

# Approach and Methodology
**Data Preparation:** Cleaned and transformed the data to make it suitable for modeling.\
**Model Development:** Tested and evaluated around 7 different machine learning algorithms.\
**Class Imbalance Handling:** Addressed the imbalance in the dataset (more "no failures" than "failures").\
**Model Tuning:** Used cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization for improved performance.\
**Pipeline Construction:** Built a pipeline to streamline and productionize the final selected model.

**Final Model Selection**
XGBoost was chosen as the final model due to its cost-effective performance and generalization capabilities. With this model, the estimated maintenance cost is around 1.26 times the minimum possible cost, while not using a predictive model could result in costs about 2.67 times the minimum. Implementing this model is expected to yield substantial cost savings.

# Important Features
The most influential features for predicting failures were identified as follows:

V18
V39
V26
V3
V10
These insights can help guide future sensor data collection to improve the model and further reduce maintenance costs.

# Business Insights and Conclusions
A machine learning model has been developed to optimize the maintenance costs of wind turbines by predicting failures.
The final chosen model, XGBoost, has been tuned to handle class imbalance and maximize cost reduction.
Deploying this model can significantly cut maintenance costs, reducing expenses to approximately 1.26 times the minimum possible amount, as opposed to roughly 2.67 times without predictive maintenance.
Key sensor data variables have been identified to help refine the model and further reduce costs.
